# :nodoc:
#
# Tracks active references over a system file descriptor (fd) and serializes
# reads and writes.
#
# Every read on the fd must lock read, every write must lock write and every
# other operation (fcntl, setsockopt, ...) must acquire a shared lock. There can
# be at most one reader + one writer + many references (other operations) at the
# same time.
#
# The fdlock can be closed at any time, but the actual system close will wait
# until there are no more references left. This avoids potential races when a
# thread might try to read a fd that has been closed and has been reused by the
# OS.
#
# Serializes reads and writes: only one attempt to read (or write) at a time can
# go through, which avoids situations where 2 readers are waiting, then the
# first reader is resumed but doesn't consume everything, then the second reader
# will never be resumed. With this lock, a waiting reader will always be resumed.
